Prerequisites

.NET SDK: Youâ€™ll need the .NET 5.0 SDK. You can download it from the official .NET download page.
Node.js: This includes npm, which youâ€™ll need for the React app. You can download it from the official Node.js download page.
Step 1: Create the Project First, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Then run these commands:

dotnet new react -o reactnet-tutorial
cd reactnet-tutorial

This will create a new .NET project with a React front end in a folder called reactnet-tutorial, and then navigate into that folder.

Step 2: Install Dependencies Next, navigate into the ClientApp folder, which is where the React app is located. Then install the npm dependencies:

cd ClientApp
npm install

Step 3: Navigate Back to Root Directory After the installation is complete, navigate back to the root directory of your project:

cd ..

Step 4: Run the Application Now youâ€™re ready to run your application. Use this command:

dotnet run

This will start both the .NET server and the React development server. You can now open your web browser and navigate to https://localhost:5001 to see your application.

Step 5: Develop Your Application Open your project in Visual Studio Code. Youâ€™ll see a ClientApp folder (this is your React app) along with various .NET configuration files. The entry point for the React application is ClientApp/src/index.js. The main layout for the website is in ClientApp/src/components/Layout.js, and the home page is in ClientApp/src/components/Home.js. You can start developing your application now. Any changes you make to the React application will be live reloaded in your browser, thanks to Create React App.

Step 6: Build for Production When youâ€™re ready to build a production-ready version of your application, you can run:

dotnet publish -c Release

This command will create a production build of your React app and place it in the build folder within ClientApp. It will also compile your .NET code and place it alongside your static files.

Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™ve just created a .NET app with a React front end using Visual Studio Code, developed it, and prepared it for production. Happy coding! ðŸš€
